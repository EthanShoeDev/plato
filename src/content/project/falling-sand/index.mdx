# What is Falling Sand?

Falling sand is a simulation in which particles of
different substances interact with each other and
the environment. The particles are affected by gravity
and can be moved around by the user.
The particles can also interact with each other,
for example, water can flow into a hole in the ground,
or fire can burn wood.
The simulation is very simple, but it can be used to
create complex systems. For example, a simple system
can be used to simulate the weather, or a more complex
system can be used to simulate the spread of a disease.
